# Business plan and financial projection for Deepvision

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Concept
Deepvision brings the machine learning AI model to the infrared spectrometer in a modern way
where both the training and classification service is done totally online.
This means the classifier is always the latest and best-trained version.
The smart sensors are integrated with a high speed 4G data module which minimize the latency.
<br>
<br>

### 1.2 Cloud Container 
The benefits of moving the architecture to the cloud is numerous.
For instance, the sensor will enjoy the latest supercomputer level performance without investing in any hardware.
However, Traditional cloud system relies on expensive rental of cloud server and their maintainace.
Deepvision will use the modern standard of Kubernetes managed container system where server will be deployed across multiple cloud server in order to garuntee a near 100% availability.
<br>
<br>
### 1.3 deep continual learning neural network
The advantage of using an neural network based deep learning system instead of 
the commonly used traditional regression algorithm eg partial least squares 
regression has been demonstrated in many application such as Google image 
classifier, Nvidia AI enhanced GPU rendering.

The reason neural network classifiers have a significantly higher performance 
is that a deep learning network is able to accept a very large number of inputs and adapt the algorithm over time
hence it is learning from its own experience.

Unlike traditional system, deep continual learning model performance significantly increases over usage.
As an AI specialist company, Deepvision focuses on developing the best learning algorithm to minimize the amount of samples required before the performance reaches a satisfactory level.

It has been forcasted that neural network classifier will replace mose other traditional classifier software in the near future.
The AI framework that Deepvision will use include Tensorflow, Pytorch, and our inhouse framework. These will continuously be benchmarked against each other to provide the best performace for our customer.
<br>
<br>

### 1.4 AI Products
There will be 2 models of AI products for DVMLOS 
1. infrared resolution enhancer and noise reducer
* AI filter is superior to a traditional hardware filter, we will be able to archieve a more accurate infrared output in term of noise, certainty, and resolution. 
* This is done by getting multiple erratic readings from the hardware sensor and use AI interpolation instead of simple average function.
<br>
2. AI regressor and classifier
* AI classifier is designed to make sense of the Infrared data. contrary to the traditinal software which uses a determined peaks comparison algorithm, the AI is able to make use of all the spectrum generated by the functional group including extremely weak ones. This gives it the ability to generate a higher accuracy of the chemical composition.
<br>
<br>
### 1.5 Deepvision Values
The core value of Deepvision system lies within quality training data, trained neural network, optimization calibration of hardware and learning algorithm.
We believe that these factors are appropriate benchmarks for the company to persue.


## 2. Product plan



### 2.1 Hardware and hardware enhancer algorithm
>We are planning to launch the AI Infrared reader hardware with our own modification including:


1. AI resolution enhancer. The AI will be integrated in the firmware API caller.


2. hardware modification to enhance both the range and resolution


### Major hardware product versions are planned by following schedule

|Date|Hardware Version| Enhancement|post-enhance resolution|range|
|----|----------------|------------|-----------|-----|
|June 2019|1.0|hardware|5nm|1500nm|
|Dec 2019|2.0|hardware,AI|2nm|2000nm|
|June 2020|3.0|hardware,AI|1nm|3000nm|
|Dec 2020|4.0|hardware,AI|0.5nm|3000nm|

2.1.2 Cheaper hardware

Hardware are aimed at a smaller professional use market in the year 2019-2021. However, we ultimately aim for a commercial use for non-specilaized customers.
This means that the main goal is to develop a sustainably priced device that is accessible to everyone.

There is a chance that in the future, some manufacturer will produce a reasonably priced NIR sensor. In that case, DVMLOS will be a great beneficiary with our vast collection of data a trained model.

Another solution is to build an extension which makes use of smartphone sensors to measure infrared spectrum. This will require a much more research both in term of firmware and capabilities of those cameras. However, if this is successful, we will be able to expand exponentially.

### 2.2 Software
> We plan to experiment with new training algorithm of AI to enhance both the functions and accuracy every quarter. The major update categories are:
1. GPU parralelization optimization for training
2. optimization of deep learning nodes depth and width
3. optimization of learning algorithm convergence
4. Our algorithms will be periodically against the state of art opensourced framework including Tensorflow and Pytorch. This will give us a choice to either use part of their libraries, and to further integrate our framework to theirs.

### Major software version are planned according the following schedule

| Date      | Version | Data trained(sets) | Chemicals supported | models tested | Training method variations tested |
|-----------|---------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|

## 3. Source of income
### 3.1 Product and Services
income will arise from 2 major sources
* Hardware sales
	* model x
			* A cost effective medium resolution hardware aimed at authenticity verification application
	* model y
			* A high performance high resolution infrared spectrometer aimed at a detailed material analysis
* Service fee
	* subscription to the regressor and classifier service
	* Maintainance of the hardware




#### 3.1.1 Hardware
2 hardware categories are in the pipeline:


| model | wavelegth (nm) | hardware resolution(nm) | optimized resolution(nm) | applications                                |
|-----|---------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| x   |900-1700 nm    |2 nm                   | 0.5(improving) | authenticity verification, quality control |
| y   |900-2500 nm    |1 nm                   | 0.5(improving) | detailed analysis of components concentration |

<b>1. Model x</b> 

These are the hardwares that doesn't require any input or modification from the users. We provide full service and charge the full service fee. 
Users of this service are aimed at non-technical end users who has no development team for computing service.

<b>2. Model y</b>

Model y are focused on users who are looking to analyze concentration of components in the samples. Especially if the infrared signature is not strong within the range of model x. We expect a very high accuracy output Especially after ML enhancer.


<b>cheaper model for gerneral users</b>

The key to success of DVMLOS in a longer term is to expand to a general user or lower cost business model.

The primary plan is to work with cheaper supplier such as [SCiO](https://www.consumerphysics.com/business/technology/)

moreover there is also a possibility to use cameras on a common smartphone such as iphone to obtain an infrared spectrum.


#### 3.1.2 Services

3 services categories in the pipeline

<b>1. Subscription model</b><br>

While the AI singnal enhancer to users that purchase our full stack sensor modules, subscription service is available
to all users including the ones that use a different hardware from leading brands such as Bruker.
The service is both available through AWS API gateway and our easy to use site.
Users simply has to upload the appropriate file and specify their parameter, and the ML model will generate the output for them.

main services including
* analyzing concentration
* matching authenticity
* adding custom chemical/chemical groups*
* submitting additional training data to improve accuracy

*custom chemical can be shared with other users


<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>2. Signal enhancer</b>

Signal enhancer model is available free of charge for users who are using our sensor.
The service is deployed through aws API Gateway or equivalent.
The enhancer functions are
* boost signal to noise ratio
* increase resolution (by ML extrapolation)
* remove background noise


<br><br>

<b>3. Maintainance</b>

This is a subscription for customers that purchase the full stack hardware who require a full support on keeping the system running. The service fee will be charged per year.

## 4 Financial Projection

We have estimated the following financial projections with the following assumptions

### 4.0 Assumptions for the model
#### Pricing and Volume Assumptions
##### Selling prices
Sellling price starts at 10,000 and will reduce over time
For model Y, price will start at 30,000 USD and reduce over time

##### Sales volume
we expect the sales growth to be linear with small growth rate
due to the difficulty in entering the market

##### Subscription
we expect subscription without purchase to be slow at first, but increase rapidly
as users of other sensors are able to use the API.

Subscription cost will be charged at 100 USD per month

##### Yearly maintainanace revenue
we will charge the users 10% of product cost per year for product maintainance

#### Cost Assumptions

##### cost of the model X
the fixed cost is 5000 USD
Variable cost follows a reverse exponential with a formular A*exp(-Bt)
where t= time

##### cost of the model Y
the fixed cost is 10,000 USD
Variable cost follows a reverse exponential curve with the same formular as model X

##### cost of running subscription server and yearly maintainence
The cost of running server is expected to be approx $10 per user per month

### 4.1 Hardware business

The products will be initially quite difficult to sell due to the corporate use environment and 
the cost which is higher than consumer level products even for model X.

However, we are planning to reduce the cost for model x as the volume increase and focus on selling quantity instead of 
revenue since most profit will be generated through subscription.
<br>
This should lead to an exponentially growing sales Especially after the price hits consumer target 
range
<br>


<b>Model X</b>
This is a cheaper model aimed at authenticity verification and other lower requirement application.
We are going to start selling at approx 10,000 USD per unit and aim to reduce the price by 25% yearly 
hitting an inflexion point in 5 years at 2000 USD and reaching consumers at 1000 USD in 7 years.

<b>Model Y</b>
This is a higher performance model that aims at a more sophisticated users looking to get the
exact concentration of components. The 0.5 nm resolution after enhancement should be sufficient
to obtain a highly accurate concentration estimation. 
Although the starting price is much higher than model at $30,000, the price is still competitive compared to
other established competitors such as Bruker.




<b>2. Service</b><br>

Service revenue arise from 2 sources:
* Maintainance fee
> Maintaince fee is charged to the customer who purchased the full stack hardware. Although there is a high potential for revenue, it involves using a large labour force which leads to high cost.

!['fig 4.1.2 Revenue from Maintainace fee'](https://github.com/thanakijwanavit/fishaicharts/blob/master/profitability_of_maintainace.png?raw=true)



* subscription

subscription is the best way for the company to make a sustainable income while minimizing the barrier to entry.
The service will be available both as API, mobile app (iOS used by full stack) and webapp. The apps can be downloaded
for free through apple store.
API service is aimed at other developers who would like to use our ML model with vast experience.
Webapp and apps are easy ways for users of other sensors such as bruker to make sense of their collected
data.
Ultimately subscription is the main source of income for the company and the service quality will improve with more userscalls and data submission



!['fig 4.1.3 Revenue from API calls'](https://github.com/thanakijwanavit/fishaicharts/blob/master/profitability_of_api_calls.png?raw=true)


<b>Source of income comparison</b>

Although sales is the main driver of revenue, the service business will become more profitable and sustainable due to the fact that the running cost is a fixed cost and does not increse significantly as the demand increase.


!['fig 4.1.4 service vs hardware revenue'](https://github.com/thanakijwanavit/fishaicharts/blob/master/hardware_vs_service_revenue.png?raw=true)
!['fig 4.1.5 service vs hardware profit'](https://github.com/thanakijwanavit/fishaicharts/blob/master/hardware_vs_service_profit.png?raw=true)


<i>The forcasted revenue generated from hardware vs service over 30 months</i>
### 4.2 Costs
1. Full stack hardware
	* Cost of goods sold include standalone sensor module, casing, and other consumables
	* Fixed cost include labour, system maintainance, rent, and other monthly costs.
2. Standalone sensors
	* Cost of goods sold include sensor, modification hardware, and consumables
consumables

![fig 4.2.1 Summary of expense](https://github.com/thanakijwanavit/fishaicharts/blob/master/expense.png?raw=true)

### 4.3 Cash flow

Cash flow will be negative in the first 20 months due to the high cost of semi-complete modules.  However, we aim to achieve breakevn by the month 22 as the cost decreases and we use a cheaper alternative due to the advancement of the AI.
The business model only takes into account the core business. If we are able to get more cashflow into the company, we aim to use at least 50% on obtaining the training data. 
Training data is one of the most important factor that determines how fast and accurate the AI will perform.

![fig 4.3.1 cash flow](https://github.com/thanakijwanavit/fishaicharts/blob/master/cashflow.png?raw=true)

in case that we have more investment than the minimum required, the forecasted cash flow will look like the one below.


![fig 4.3.2 cash flow including development](https://github.com/thanakijwanavit/fishaicharts/blob/master/cashflow_including_development.png?raw=true)

## 5 Valuation

### 5.1 Valuation by DCF

#### Growth
Valuation of the company can be calculated from the projected cash flow assuming a conservative terminal growth after 30 months of 15% per year.

#### Discount rate
Discount rate is calculated at 20% due to the high uncertainty of the newly established company. This is considered conservative given that the world market average growth rate is well under 10% per annum.

#### Valuation
Valuation is done by calculating the perceptual discounted cash flow at the rate agreed in previous section. This gives a conservative valuation of approximately 3 million USD.
Note that this assume a constand 15% growth rate which in reality we are aiming for it to be more exponential as per the nature of a scalable software business.


![fig 5.4.1 valuation by DCF](https://github.com/thanakijwanavit/fishaicharts/blob/master/valuation_by_DCF.png?raw=true)

### 5.2 Valuation by comparison to the market(P/E, Revenue, and growth rate)

#### Period of valuation
The company aims  to complete a series C which indicates a pseudo maturity at approximately 30 months.
This is the timeline which can be used for profit comparison with the market.

#### Comparison to market P/E
The market average P/E of software business sector is [some numbers](). This is referenced from().

#### Valuation

Searting in 30 months, the company is expected to have an annual earning of approximately 300K which translates to the valuation of 12-24 million USD. The valuation over the 15 years period is forcasted as per the chart below.

![fig 5.2.1 valuation by PE](https://github.com/thanakijwanavit/fishaicharts/blob/master/valuation_by_PE.png?raw=true)

### 5.3 Summary of valuation
It is apparent that the valuation using PE ratio gives a much higher value than the discounted cashflow approach. This is mostly due to an oversimplified DCF earning growth model which is kept constant at 15%. Meanwhile the PE valuation expects a market rate of growth as the company mature which is usually expected to be much higher than 15%. 
Note that the market valuation using PE is more realistic for a technological startup due to the variable growth rate. DCF is usually a suitable index for valuing a mature company.
